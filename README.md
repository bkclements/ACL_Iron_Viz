# ACL_Iron_Viz

### This repository holds the code used for my Tableau Iron Viz submission. The topic this year was Visualizing the Arts, so I gathered data related to the annual Austin City Limits (ACL) music festival. I primarily used Spotipy and Pandas to gather and organize data for this project.

### The order in which code for this respository was written/executed is: 
1. acl_playlist_creator
2. acl_genre_finder
3. acl_merge_data

### Please feel free to fork or comment, or reach out to me at brettkclements@gmail.com for any comments or questions.
